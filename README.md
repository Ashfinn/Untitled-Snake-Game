#Untitled Snake Game
##Overview
This Python project is a simple implementation of the classic snake game. Using the Turtle graphics library, it features a basic snake that grows as it eats food, and a scoreboard to keep track of the player's score. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

##Installation
To run this game, you need Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required as it uses the built-in turtle module for graphics.

##Usage
Run the main script to start the game. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Eat food to increase your score. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

##Files

Gameplay
